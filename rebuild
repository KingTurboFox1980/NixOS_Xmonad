First, run these two commands in your terminal

nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install

and 

sudo cachix use crazazy


Then, rebuild your NixOS system

sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#K10

when completed

reboot

cd /etc/nixos

then copy the flake from the backup to /etc/nixos
using sudo nano to edit the file and copy from the backup

sudo nix flake init

then, use the nix_update.sh script to rebuild like normal

By running the cachix use crazazy command before you rebuild, you ensure that your Nix installation 
is already aware of and configured to use the crazazy binary cache. When nixos-rebuild switch then starts 
to evaluate and build your system, Nix will check the crazazy cache for pre-built versions of the packages 
it needs. If it finds them, it will download them (substitute) instead of building them locally, making the 
rebuild process much, much faster for those components.
